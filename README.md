A mod created for [ModFest 1.21](https://modfest.net/1.21) that desyncs a given player's client-side world time from the server's, with new blocks and items that behave according to the player's separate percieved time.

(Also I only found out about the event like two weeks after it started! So this mod is a lot more rushed than I would otherwise like. Oh well.)

Currently adds:
- The mechanic of being able to offset a player's percieved time, as well as its speed (including reversing!)
- A lot of potions and status effects to manipulate that offset
- Gems that correspond to times of day (day, night, dawn/dusk)
- Dusts that correspond to phases of the moon (full, gibbous, quarter, crescent, new)
- Blocks that only let you pass through them if your percieved time matches the block
  - Also blocks that *reset* your time to the server's when you pass through them
